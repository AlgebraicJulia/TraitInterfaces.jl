This package largely came from extracting pieces of [GATlab.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/GATlab.jl), developed by Owen Lynch and Kris Brown, based on Evan Patterson's original work on GATs (generalized algebraic theories) in Catlab. In this repo, the GAT aspects have been stripped away. Many projects in the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem rely on interfaces without using the understanding of interfaces as being the objects of category. GATlab will focus on this latter goal.
